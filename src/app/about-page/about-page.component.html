                        Enzymes serve as the molecular machines of life and essential biocatalysts for numerous
                        biotechnological and biomedical applications. Open Enzyme Database (OED) is a community-driven,
                        open-access repository and infrastructure for sharing enzyme data. The database serves as a
                        critical resource for researchers and practitioners in biochemistry, molecular biology,
                        enzymology, protein and metabolic engineering, and related fields, currently offering quantities

                        algorithms, has also been completed. These tools will be instrumental in identifying potential
                        enzymes capable of catalyzing new substrates. </h5>

                    <h5 class="leading-xl">Looking ahead, OED plans to expand its scope to encompass a wide array of
                        enzyme-related
                        information, including data on enzyme solubility, stability, specificity, selectivity, functions
                        and associated enzymatic reactions, thereby becoming a comprehensive resource for the scientific

                        drug discovery, metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and synthetic chemistry, but also for
                        machine learning experts who are interested in enzyme property and function prediction and
